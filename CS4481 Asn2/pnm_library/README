If you want to use using the pnm library in your program:

1- put the following #include line in the top of your code
   #include "libpnm.h"

2- put in the same directory:
   - the library (libpnm.a), 
   - the include file (libpnm.h), and 
   - your program

3- execute the following command:
   gcc -Wall example.c -o example -I. -L. -lpnm

PS: If you want to compile the library again, you can just "make" it again.
